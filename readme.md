This is The Most Useless Clock in the World. It tells time, and nothing else. But it is very stylish and can easily be seen across a room.

# Why the hell would you do something like this?

Building a clock, or some such basic-yet-useful device, is a typical beginners' electronics project which I would highly recommend to anyone looking to start out in the hobby. It teaches the following:

* Electronics
* Soldering, particularly for surface mount components
* Circuit design
* Embedded systems software development
* Cost-reduction techniques

So yeah, this is a dumb hobby project that I keep going back to because it's interesting. And it's a nice way to spend an evening: by cursing at surface-mounted electronic components.
