Secrets go in here. (.gitignore ignores all ini files in this directory for a good reason)

Under normal circumstances you'll see two files here:
* factory.ini: "Factory defaults", let's call them, that setup platform-specific stuff. (See defaults/ directory in root for examples)
* secrets.ini: User-specific configuration.
